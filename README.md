# LoanApprovalPrediction-Machine-Learning-
This is Machine Learning project in kaggle competition. The main purpose of this project is identify whether  loan is approved or not based on person other factors. For completing this I used the several classification models like decisiontreeclassifier, randomforestclassifier, supportvectorclassifier, and kneighborclassifier. Dataset is recived from kaggle competion.
